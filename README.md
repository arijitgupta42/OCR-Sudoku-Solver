# OCR-Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku Solver on python with OCR to read the sudoku from images

## OCR
The OCR is a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset, procedure can be found in `train_model.py`

## Solving the Sudoku
The sudoku that is extracted from the images is solved using a backtracking algorithm

## Running the project
If you wish to simply see the results then you can run `solver.py` and if you want to retrain the model the you can do it from `train_model.py`

P.S. Sample of the results of running `solver.py` in a terminal window are there in `working.png`
